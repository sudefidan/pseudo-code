Design an algorithm of the electromagnetic spectrum bands program as follows. The program will run in two different cases. 
In the first case the student will enter the frequency value, the program will give the name of the electromagnetic wave according to Table 1.
In the second case, the wave name will be entered, the frequency range values will be displayed on the screen. 
The program will start by asking which case will be chosen. If the user enters a value rather than 1 and 2, the program will end. otherwise it will continue. 

Table 1. Some Electromagnetic Waves within Each Frequency Band

Name	            The range of frequency
Gamma rays	      300 EHz - 30 EHz
X-rays	          30 EHz - 30 PHz
Ultraviole	      30 PHz - 300 THz
Infrared	        300 THz - 300 GHz

ANSWER:
Step 1:Start                                                        /*Start the program*/
Step 2: Enter the number 1 or 2 as 1= enter the frequency value, display the name of the electromagnetic wave and 2=enter the wave name, display the frequency range values
                                                                            /*Read option as 1( the student will enter the frequency value, display the name of the electromagnetic wave) and 2(the wave name will be entered, display the frequency range values)
Step3: If number=1,go to step 4 or if not go to step 6                
                                                                            /*If number which is given by user is 1,go to step4 or if not go to step 6*/
Step4: Input the range of frequency           /*Read the frequency value*/
Step5: Output the name of electromagnetic wave
                                                                           /*Print the name of electromagnetic wave */
Step6: If number=2, go to step 7 or if not go to step 9              
                                                                           /*If number which is given by user is 2,go to step 7 or if not go to step 9*/
Step7: Input the name of electromagnetic wave
                                                                         /*Read the name of electromagnetic wave */
Step 8: Output the range of frequency    /*Print the frequency value*/   
Step9: Stop                                                   /*Stop the program*/
